Krakow, a southern Poland city near the border of the Czech Republic, is known for its well-preserved medieval core and Jewish quarter. Its old town ringed by Planty Park and remnants of the city's medieval walls is centered on the stately, expansive Rynek Glewny (market square). This plaza is the site of the Cloth Hall, a Renaissance-era trading outpost, and St. Mary's Basilica, a 14th-century Gothic church.
